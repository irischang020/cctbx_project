## Diffraction Experiment Toolbox

This code has now moved into a separate repository.
If you set up your build environment after April 2019 it should already include
the necessary changes.

Otherwise you can pick up dxtbx from its new location by running the command
```bash
libtbx.install dxtbx
```
which will install dxtbx in the modules/ directory.

If you have any cctbx\_project development branches that touch the dxtbx
directory and need help in transferring commits over please open an issue on
Github and we are happy to help.
