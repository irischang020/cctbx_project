0. Rebased onto master and resolved conflicts

1. Validated TextCtrl
    - unit cell control - validates obligatory six parameters, which must be
      numbers
    - Return None or Auto (depending on None/Auto parameters) if input is
      whitespace. (Also fixed and streamlined None or Auto ID)
    - Fixed bug where if error was fixed, it was still registered as error

2. Base definition panel
    - makes control background red if an error, beige if value is not default


Known issue: need to keep default settings throughout, and store changes in a
different attribute
